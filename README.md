# BUILD-Tool
This tool works like a "make" tool for IBM i native languages such as RPG, CL, etc. The idea is that you can put comments at the top of your program that provide the commands needed to compile it, and when you run the BUILD tool, it will run those commands.

This tool is forked from Scott Klement build tool, that can be found here: https://www.scottklement.com/build/
